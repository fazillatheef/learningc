- You can assign value and use that in a condition together.
        Eg:-
        while((ch = getchar()) != EOF)

- EOF can be input using Ctrl + D(in Linux). What happens is that no input is passed and getchar() return
-1 which is equal to EOF in stdlib.h

- All variables that are declared in a program resides in the stack. Anything that is dynamically 
allocated is stored in the heap.

- A literal can also be used in printf instead of a variable. And the size of a literal is 4 bytes.

- ++a will first increment and then use the value, a++ will first evaluate a and then increment

- To check memory used by a program that is running can be done using the following

        Checked memory allocation by examining 
        cat /proc/<pid>/maps
        The memory address for the malloc was in the heap and the local variable was in the stack.

- You can assign values together like this
        nl = nc = nw = 0;

- Format with leading zeroes using the following syntax
        printf("%05d",5);        

- When you have many conditions with ||, it will execute from left to right

- Wall option should be always used while compiling C program in gcc

- Type of basic variable types in C
        - unsigned & signed
                - char
                - int
                        - short
                        - long
                - float
                        - short
                        - long
                - double
                        - short
                        - long
        extern -> for global
        static -> Keep it between multiple calls
        cons -> Compiler stops change of value

 - '' and "" are different. '' is for single character and "" is for character array
