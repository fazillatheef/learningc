Here the trick is to first move the middle item to the beginning.
[Otherwise if there are more elements that are less than the middle 
element. Then the middle element must be moved everytime an element
is moved to left partition.]

Then move all the elements less than the middle one(which is now at 
the beginning) to the 2nd position onwards. Then the last one that 
is less than middle one is swapped. Now every element to the left
of the middle one is less than the middle element. Please note that the middle 
element may not be in the exact middle. Rest is just repeating the 
same for the two sides of the array. In C, the array is passed by 
reference. To implement this in python, list data type can be used
as it is immutable and python will pass it by reference only
